# Library-Management
A Library Management Project Using Data Structure and Algorithms

## Features of the Library Management System
Add Books

Store book details such as Title, Author, ISBN, and Availability Status.
Use a Hash Table for quick lookup by ISBN or Title.
Search Books

Search by Title, Author, or ISBN.
Implement efficient searching algorithms like Binary Search for sorted data.
Borrow Books

Track borrowing details (Book, Borrower, Date).
Use a Queue to manage borrowing requests.
Return Books

Update the bookâ€™s availability status and remove it from the borrower's list.
Book Recommendations

Suggest books based on popular borrowing trends using a Priority Queue.
User Management

Add and manage user accounts (Name, ID, Borrowed Books).
Use Linked Lists to store user details.
Overdue Notifications

Use a Min-Heap to keep track of due dates for borrowed books.

## Data Structures to Use
Hash Table: For fast retrieval of books by ISBN or Title.
Linked List: To store users and their borrowed books.
Queue: For managing borrowing requests.
Heap: For overdue notifications and book popularity tracking.
Binary Search Tree (BST): To store and sort book data for efficient searching.
Project Structure
Modules

Book.py: Class for book-related operations.
User.py: Class for user-related operations.
Library.py: Main library operations like adding books, borrowing, and returning.
Main.py: Entry point to the program with a CLI/GUI.
Algorithms

Sorting: Use Merge Sort or Quick Sort for book data.
Searching: Binary Search for sorted book data.
Graph (optional): If you want to implement a recommendation system based on book co-borrowing.
Input/Output

Use files (e.g., .csv or .json) to store book and user data persistently.
Optionally, integrate with a database like SQLite for advanced features.

## Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: tkinter (for GUI), json or sqlite3 (for storage)
Version Control: Git and GitHub
